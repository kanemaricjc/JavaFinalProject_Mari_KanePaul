# KP's Banking System
### Problem Statement
This program would solve the problem of limitations, convenience, and efficiency for consumer banking. Since people are not needed to go to their respective banks, this also removes the need to wait in very long lines just to deposit/withdraw their money.
### Program Features
Currently, this program authenticates pre-made accounts, but should you want to make a manual account, you would need to input it into the database.txt itself. Currently, the database.txt is unencrypted, but I will be working to encrypt this program for future purposes. You can make deposits/withdrawals, and can log out in the dashboard whenever you are done.
### How to Run The Program
When the code is run, a GUI instance will appear, asking for the user's account and password. These parameters are then authenticated and, if successful, will make a Dashboard instance where the user can make deposits/withdrawals. After the user is done with their transactions, the user can then log out to prevent unauthorized access.
